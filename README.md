# Overview of the project
# project: Mobile App Wireframing
# objective
  Wireframes help in defining the user flow and navigation paths within the app. By outlining how users will move through different screens and interact with various elements, 
  designers can ensure that the app is intuitive and easy to navigate.

# key Activities
  Wireframe Creation: Use wireframing tools (e.g., Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, Balsamiq) to create mid-fidelity wireframes that outline the app's screens and basic UI elements.
  Handoff to Development: Provide developers with finalized wireframes and prototypes, along with design specifications and assets.

# Technologies Used  
   Wireframing Tools: Balsamiq: A tool focused on low-fidelity wireframing with a sketch-like feel.
   UI Design Tools: Adobe XD, Sketch, and Figma can also be used for detailed UI design after wireframing.
